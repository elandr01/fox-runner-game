ideas:
- a study tool for calc students that generates random calc problems
- maybe make it a game?
- Calculus->
- Derivatives-> Power Rule, Quotient Rule, Product Rule, Trig functions
- Integrals -> Power Rule, By parts, Partial fractions, Trig functions, Inverse Trig functions, ln(x)/ e^{x}
- -Indefinite/Improper Integrals -> 
- Limits -> 0/0 || c/0
