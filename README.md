- Add puzzles
- Give it an adventurous setting
- Have different Levels. For now 1 level.
- Add a starting Menu and a Pause Menu

FOR THE FILES NOTE:
- Must have the resources folder with the sprite sheet
- Directory of the folder must be set to a resources root
- If there is no resource folder in the program than an exception will be thrown
